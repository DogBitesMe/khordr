;; Behaviors
;;
;; A behavior is a map with keys `:match` and `:handler`. The :match
;; dictates how the handler is selected. If it is a map, it can have
;; the keys `:key` and/or `:direction` which must match the keyevent
;; map that is passed in. If the value for :key or :direction is a
;; set, any value from the set matches.
;;
;; The :handler must be a symbol that specifies a namespace-qualified
;; Clojure record or a package-qualified Java class (support for Java
;; classes pending). If present, the optional `:args` entry of the
;; behavior map specifies a vector of arguments to the class or record
;; constructor.
