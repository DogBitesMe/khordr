* Things I tried

Send only key up/down events with flags modified for shift on
HIDEventTab: works.

Send only key up/down events with flags modified for control on
HIDEventTab: does not work. Puts system into some sort of weird state
where emacs won't receive any more keys. Not sure what's up with that.

Send only key up/down events with flags modified for control on
HIDEventTab, plus also send control up at the end: still doesn't work.
Screws emacs up pretty good until you type a regular key.

For a, send an e down, e up, but set the control flag on the down
event and not on the up event: still screws up emacs.

I think we might need to somehow send the flags changed event by
itself. Maybe I can post the down modifier key as well?

Sending an explicit keyboard event with the keycode for left control
doesn't work.
